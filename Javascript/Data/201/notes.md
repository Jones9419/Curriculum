## Data types can be collected in other structures like objects and arrays.

### Objects
An object describes something. It lives inside of opening and closing curly braces and is organized as key:value pairs, seperated by commas. The key and the value are themselves seperated by a `:`.
```
const car = {
 color: 'green',
 mileage: 67302,
 isNew: false
};
```


### Arrays
An array is a list of items. It is defined by opening and closing square brackets. The items in the array are seperated by commas. Each item in an array is indexed with a number. Arrays can contain all other data types as well as objects.
```
constShoppingList = ['apples', 'celery', 'bread'];
const ages = [7, 7, 8, 8, 7.5];
const cars = [
    {
        color: 'green',
        mileage: 67302,
        isNew: false
    },
     {
        color: 'red',
        mileage: 37142,
        isNew: false
    },
     {
        color: 'blue',
        mileage: 167209,
        isNew: false
    },
     {
        color: 'yellow',
        mileage: 14301,
        isNew: false
    },
];
